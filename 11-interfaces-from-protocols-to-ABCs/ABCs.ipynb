    "ABCs are meant to encapsulate very general concepts, abstractions, introduced by a framework - things like \"a sequence\" and \"an exact number\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Why ABCs:\n",
    "- By inheriting from ABCs we make a clear declaration of intent and are forced to implement all of the relevant methods of a given protocol.\n",
    "- If we check isinstance() we are mostly interested whether the object follows a certain protocol (not whether it is an object of a certain type) and as such it is better to tests against ABCs.\n",
    "- Checking against ABC with isinstance is especially useful if you must enforce an API contract: \"Dude, you have to implement this if you want to call me\".\n",
    "\n",
    "However, excessive type checking might be a sign of poor design. You should be leveraging polymorphism, designing your classes so that the interpreter dispatches calls to proper methods instead of hard coding choices based on types. For example, if you built a class that requires `list` argument, instead of checking you can immediately build a `list` from it, this way you can accept any iterable."
