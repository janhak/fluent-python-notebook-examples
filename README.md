# Examples and Exercises from Fluent Python Book
This repo contains code examples and exercises from the [excellent book](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920032519.do) by Luciano Ramalho about Python programming language.
Most of the examples are in Jupyter Notebook format as it leands itself very well to tinkering and re-running the code.
